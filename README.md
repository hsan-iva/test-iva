Numbered lists have the prefix with a number, followed by a '.' and a space and then the text(ex: 1. Text 2. Another text) The number needn't be sequential. 
GML will autoatically take care of numbering them sequentially when you save it.

1. one
1. two
2. three
   
For unordered list prefix with a * or -
* First
  * Nested
* Second
* Third


- One
- Two
  - three
